Hangman-Game-Using-LSTM(Neural_Net)
===

Introduction
---
In this implementation of Hangman Game, the user gives the program a word(which is hidden) and the program tries to predict it given some contraints. For complete info about the problem you can refer to Hangman_rules.txt file.  
The solution uses LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) model of Neural Network(for more info on LSTM refer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory).
